The License specifies the **requirements** for qualification of use and inherently the policy under which the license shall be granted for governmental-, intelligence*-*, commercial-, institutional*-,* scientific*- or* personal use**.** Its **Source code**, **documentation** and **machine- or human readable configuration files**, **artistic subcontents** or **naming conventions** (”**The Software**”) shall be subject to this license in full. 

# Code of Ethics

## 1. Military Doctrine, Commerical Policy & Climate Protection

The software shall never be **used**, **transformed into**, **be included in** or **aid**; any personal-,  governmental, intelligence type-, scientific- or commercial effort; that harms civilians by the means of electronic, psychological or physical warfare. The software shall not be used in any effort that plausibly negatively affects earth climate stability, for example for the abuse, obfuscation or circumvention of automotive policymaker guidelines on emissions, development or guidance of munitions of (mass) destruction, or psychological analysis software / lab equipment automation in synthetic biology that operates on scientific assets extracted by illicit human or animal experiments.  This includes scientific research, especially in the realm of (synthetic) biology, medicinal research and healthcare, (pharmaceutical) chemistry and/or computer (security) sciences. Restriction of use for offensive purposes meant to target entire populations or civilian groups, or individuals, inflict the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as well as, neural integrity and freedom of will and choice, and is illiciting induction of fear or intimidation. The software may never be used to aid psychological operations or governmental intelligence- / corporate- espionage, violating the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, specifically Article 12.

## 2. Physical and Mental Integrity of Living Things

Although there is no United Nations, or otherwise internationally agreed on *set of policies* or *guidelines* for non-invasiveness of psychological effect by information campaigns, common principles on the preservation of mental/neural integrity, animal testing/experimentation; are hereby set forth. The Wyvra License hereby sets forth the principle of ethical consideration of *free will and choice* in the application of information distribution (”news”, “information campaigns”) or application of artifical intelligence / code bases that is distributed to and permanently affects, or extracts information from, large parts of the Internet or devices connected to it. Scientific-/Engineering ambition in biological, information, computer, physical or chemical realms is advised. The use of synthetically produced test environments (biological synthetic cells rather than full grown subjects of any species) or extraction of data from computer simulations rather than observation is hereby required.

## 3. Cryptographic Variations

Any of the cryptographic material, claims, mathematical algebraic or geometric formula, which may or may not be included in **the Software** is likely to break at application of raw force, computational power or mathematical intrinsicery. You are advised to rely on it, for ethical use, for a short amount of time before switching it.

## 4. Clandestine Chemistry

Don’t sell too high potency.
